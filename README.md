# Dubin's Paths

Rust code for calculating Dubin's Paths

Credit to [Andrew Walker](https://github.com/AndrewWalker) for the [original C code](https://github.com/AndrewWalker/Dubins-Curves)

I've ported the code to Rust and documented everything that I could understand. Documentation in the original repository was minimal.
